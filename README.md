<h2><B></B>Stock Market Analysis</h2></B>
This project looks into the dynamic world of the stock market, focusing on four prominent players: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), 3M (MMM), and Tesla (TSLA). By dissecting their recent performance, we aim to uncover valuable insights and potential investment opportunities.<br>

<h2>Our analysis will encompass various aspects, including:</h2>
<li>Price Comparison:I began by comparing the prices of the Stock across a defined timeframe. This could involve looking at historical data and comparing current price</li>
<li>Return Calculation: Next, I calculated the returns for each option over the chosen period. This would involve using formulas to determine the percentage gain or loss on each investment.</li>
<li>Cumulative Returns: To understand the total growth over time, I calculated the cumulative returns for each option.</li>
<li>Volatility: I then assessed the volatility of each option. Volatility is a measure of price fluctuations, and a high volatility indicates a riskier investment.</li>
<li>Return Distribution: Finally, I analyzed the distribution of returns for each option. This could involve creating a histogram or using statistical measures to understand how frequently certain returns occurred.</li>

<h3>Data Acquisition</h3>
<h3><b>Getting Started</b></h3>
yfinance function was used to download historical and current price data for the specified companies.
This Project requires the following libraries:
<ul>i.yfinance</ul>
<ul>ii.Pandas(for data manipulation and analysis)</ul>

The adjusted closing price is a stock's closing price that takes into account corporate actions such as stock splits and dividend distributions.It essentially reflects the true price of the stock after these events have been considered.**
